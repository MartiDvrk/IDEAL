Release 1.0, created on March 10, 2021
* This is the first public open source release of IDEAL.
* From February 2018 until March 2021 this project was maintained in a private
  repository on GitLab. During this period, the project was a collaboration
  between EBG MedAustron GmbH, ACMIT Gmbh, and the Medical University of Vienna.
  This release is practically identical to the 1.0 release in the GitLab repository,
  and was tested successfully in the clinical environment of MedAustron.
* **After** this 1.0 release, the code will be adapted such that it can be installed with 'pip' and the docs can be published on "readthedocs".
