This 'cache' directory will contain the 'caches' of Hounsfield lookup tables
(HLUTs) for the protocols defined in 'hlut.conf' in the parent directory.

The Schneider-based HLUTs are generated by Gate by interpolating materials
based on a density curve, a HU-to-composition table and a density tolerance
value. The name of each cache directory is the md5 sums of the contents of a CT
protocol's density curve file, its composition file and a (string-ified)
density tolerance value. When IDEAL wants to use a particular CT protocol as
defined in 'hlut.conf', it first checks the original density and composition
tables, computes the MD5 sum, checks if the cache directory exists, and if not,
runs a short Gate process to (re)generate it. So if you change the contents of
any of the original tables, or if you delete these cache directories, then the
caches should be automatically re-generated whenever needed for an IDEAL job.
