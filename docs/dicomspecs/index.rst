DICOM specification
###################

We will put a table here with a complete specification of all DICOM tags that are used by IDEAL:
which ones are used in which way, with what kinds of assumptions.

Unfortunately we did not manage to compile this table before the 1.0 release. We'll try to
include it in the docs 1.1 release, which should only change in the docs and in the organization
of the code, not in the actual functionality.
